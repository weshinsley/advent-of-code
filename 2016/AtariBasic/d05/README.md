## Advent of code, 2016 - DAY 5 - Atari Basic

For Day 5. 

### Abject Failure

This is the first day which I think might be impossible to achieve reasonably in Atari Basic,
unless there is something about MD5 hashing I don't know (which is possible). On the surface
of it, we have to compute a very larger number of MD5 hashes, until we get one that starts
with five zeroes. 

Most modern languages have an MD5 hasher as a standard thing. Atari Basic (1979) unfortunately
has no such built-in stuff....

Perhaps I'll return to this at the end.
