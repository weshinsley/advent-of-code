# advent-of-code-2021

You need a Java Compiler (JDK) installed, and on the path
so you can run `javac` and `java` from the command-line. With
this location as your working directory, you can:
* Compile a day with `javac d15/puzzle.java`
* Run a day with `java d15.puzzle` or `run 15`
* compile.bat or run.bat for all puzzles
* inputs are expected to be in `2021/inputs/input_15.txt`
