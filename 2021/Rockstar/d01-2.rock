Listen to my teapot
Listen to my turnip
Listen to my trump

Burn my teapot
Burn my turnip
Burn my trump

Let my tragedy be my teapot with my turnip with my trump
My trouble is gone

While my trump isn't mysterious
Let my teapot be my turnip
Let my turnip be my trump
Listen to my trump
If my trump isn't mysterious
Burn my trump
Let my travesty be my teapot with my turnip with my trump
If my travesty is greater than my tragedy
Build my trouble up

Let my tragedy be my travesty


Shout my trouble
