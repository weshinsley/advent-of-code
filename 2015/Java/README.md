# advent-of-code-2015

These are my answers for adventofcode.com 2015, written in Java. To run any, you need a Java Compiler (JDK) installed, and on the path
so you can run `javac` and `java` from the command-line. From the repository root:
* Compile with something like `javac d01/puzzle.java`
* and run with something like `java d01.puzzle`

Lots of fun puzzles - 19b I eventually "solved" in a spectacularly inelegant way.
