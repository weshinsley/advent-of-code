You need a Java Compiler (JDK) installed, and on the path
so you can run `javac` and `java` from the command-line. With
this location as your working directory, you can:
* Compile a day with `javac d01/puzzle.java`
* Run a day with `java d01.puzzle`
* compile.bat or run.bat for all puzzles
* inputs are expected to be in `2015/inputs/input_1.txt`
