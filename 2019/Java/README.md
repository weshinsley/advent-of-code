## DIDE does advent of code, 2019

Each year, [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) runs as a series of small programming challenges.  It's good fun, but it can be a lot of work to complete all the puzzles by yourself.

So the idea here is to complete the puzzles cooperatively!  Dip in and out, complete a puzzle that hasn't been done yet, or have a shot at one that has been done in a different language, with a different approach, or whatever.  Look through the alternative versions and learn something about different ways of solving problems.

Everyone who wants to can have push access to this repository - we won't be using pull requests *unless you want to suggest changes to someone else's solution*.  So a little structure is required to keep us from conflict hell.

Each day goes into a directory called **d** followd by a **two digit number** (`d01`, `d02`, ..., `d24`).  Within each directory all files that you create should be prefixed with your name or github name (whatever is most convenient and relatively unambiguous), e.g., `richfitz.R`, `richfitz-support.R`.  If you need a heap of support files for whatever reason, consider using a directory (e.g., `richfitz/`).

If you can't get a problem solved, just skip ahead until you find one you like, or use an existing solution to help get yours working.
